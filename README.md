# C-Code-Crafters

**C-Code-Crafters**, a repository dedicated to exploring the art and science of programming in C. T

## What You'll Find Here

- **Data Structures**: Examples of essential data structures including linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.
- **Utility Programs**: Useful tools and programs that demonstrate practical applications of C.
- **Games**: Fun and engaging games created using C to demonstrate programming skills in a more interactive way.

## Why C?

C is a foundational language that has influenced many modern programming languages. It offers a deep understanding of how computers work and allows you to write efficient and high-performance code.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following command to get a local copy of the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sadiasakharkar/C-Code-Crafters.git
   
2. Navigate to the Project: Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
      cd C-Code-Crafters
   

3. Build and Run: Depending on the program, you might need to compile it. Use the gcc compiler to build C programs:
     ```bash
    gcc -o output_file_name source_file_name.c
Replace output_file_name with your desired executable name and source_file_name.c with the file you want to compile. Then run the program:

    ```bash
    ./output_file_name

 Happy coding, and may your journey in C be as rewarding as it is enlightening!
